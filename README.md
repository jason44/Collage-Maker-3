# Collage-Maker-3
A simple program to view images in a collage. Mostly generated by Gemini, Deepseek, and ChatGPT. 

### Collage Maker 1
The first version used three.js to display the images. This version is very responsive, but image filtering must be applied manually which proved to be time consuming to implement. 

### Collage Maker 2
The second version used mostly CSS and the **img** tag. The image quality was much improved over version 1. The zooming feature was implemented with *CSS scale*, but performance was very poor when the images were scaled with a scaling factor less than one.

### Collage Maker 3
This version uses the canvas element which has built in image filtering capabilities so the image quality is good. The zooming feature was implemented by scaling the canvas, which is much more performant than version 2's implementation. Additionally, free movement and scaling individual images is supported in this version.
